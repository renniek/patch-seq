**Welcome to the README for the PatchSeq preprocessing directory!**


In order to run any of the functions, you will need to be able to use Sherlock. See "Using Sherlock" on the Google drive for further details, but it is fairly simple. First, you will need Scott to email the Sherlock staff on your behalf to set up an account, after which you can login with your normal password using ssh <sunetid>@login.sherlock.stanford.edu. To run the scripts in this repository, you will use the command sbatch <script_name>.sbatch
